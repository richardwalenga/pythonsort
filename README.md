# Python Sort

This code was a way for me to practice writing Python code by implementing common sorting algorithms using [what I created with Typescript](https://github.com/richardwalenga/typescriptsort) as a guide. I have logging in [test.py](test.py) which times the implementations against the same large array of random ints. This is written against Python 3.9.7.
